## What are mogul Clubs?

mogul Clubs are integrated social communities within the mogul platform.

They sit alongside the property-investment screens and give investors a dedicated space to:

- **Connect** with other members
- **Share** knowledge, deals, and best practices
- **Discuss** strategies in real time
- **Benefit** collectively from club-wide rewards
