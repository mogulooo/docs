## What are mogul Clubs?

mogul Clubs are integrated social communities within the mogul platform. They sit alongside the property-investment screens and give investors a dedicated space to:

- **Connect with other members**
- **Share knowledge, deals, and best practices**
- **Discuss strategies in real time**
- **Benefit collectively from club-wide rewards**

### Connect with other members

Members can connect through dedicated club pages. The  club directory helps you find communities aligned with your interests, whether geographic (e.g., “Texas Real Estate Investors”), strategy-focused (e.g., “Short-Term Rental Enthusiasts”), or experience-based (e.g., “Beginner Investors”). Chief Moguls regularly facilitate introductions between members, while the invitation system lets you bring colleagues into your community and help grow it out.

### Share knowledge, deals, and best practices

Knowledge sharing happens through organized discussion threads, resource libraries, and deal analysis showcases. Members can contribute their expertise and help other members learn and earn alongside them.

### Discuss strategies in real time

Real-time discussions occur through a club's discussion tab, with users notified when there has been a new post or when comments have been added to a user's post. These discussions can serve as a place for members to interact with each other, ask the Chief Mogul any questions they might have, and go over new properties uploaded to the platform.

### Benefit collectively from club-wide rewards

The 2% investment reward means that whenever a club member invests in a property, 2% of their investment amount is allocated as a reward to the club. Depending on the club’s structure, these rewards may be distributed equally between Chief Mogul and club members, exclusively to the Chief Mogul, or exclusively to club members. The transparent tracking dashboard shows all club-generated rewards in real-time.
