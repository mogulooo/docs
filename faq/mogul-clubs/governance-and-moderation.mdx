## Moderation Layers

| Layer              | Responsibility                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chief Mogul**    | First-line moderator for their club. Sets the tone and enforces rules. |
| **mogul Platform** | Enforces overall terms of service and community guidelines.            |

Members can flag content that violates rules. Repeated offenders may be removed or banned.

## Managing Members

- Chief Moguls can **remove** or **block** users who break club rules.
- Serious violations are escalated to the platform compliance team.

Clear governance keeps clubs focused, welcoming, and compliant with mogulâ€™s standards.
