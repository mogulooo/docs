- **Invested Amount & Monthly Balance** – Track principal and month-end value.
- **Monthly Yield** – Rental income ÷ invested amount for that property.
- **Weighted Average Portfolio Monthly Yield** – Portfolio-level blend using invested amounts as weights.
- **YTD Rental Income** – Cumulative payouts since January 1.
- **Annualized Yield** – Year-to-date run rate; stabilizes over time (seasonality affects early figures).



### Performance Memos & Insights
