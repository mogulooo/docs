The mogul platform provides a powerful calculator tool that allow you to deeply examine property investments and customize financial projections.

## Accessing the Calculator

The calculator is can be accessed by going to the 'Analysis' tab, allowing you to:

- View default projections across multiple scenarios
- Customize assumptions to match your investment outlook
- Analyze detailed cash flows and returns

## Scenario Analysis

### Multiple Case Views

- **Base Case:** The expected performance based on conservative assumptions
- **Bull Case:** An optimistic scenario with more favorable outcomes
- **Bear Case:** A conservative scenario accounting for potential challenges

Toggle between these to see how different assumptions affect the high-level metrics.

## Customizable Assumptions

### Revenue Assumptions

- **Monthly Rental Income:** Defaults come from comparable properties, broker estimates, manager projections, and—when available—actual performance data
- **Editable Fields:** Click any value to override it with your own projections

### Operating Expense Assumptions

- **Property Taxes:** Pre-populated based on current assessments
- **Growth Rates:** Adjustable annual growth rates for each expense category
- **Property Management Fees:** Shown as a percentage of rental income
- **Miscellaneous Costs:** Includes pool supplies, lawn care, maintenance, cleaning, etc.

### Property Appreciation

- **Annual Growth Rate:** Adjustable appreciation rate for the property value
- **Conservative Defaults:** Base case assumptions are intentionally more conservative than traditional underwriting

- **Refinance Scenarios:** Potential future refinancing based on interest-rate projections

The calculator provides year-by-year projections over a 10-year period.

### Detailed Financial Metrics
