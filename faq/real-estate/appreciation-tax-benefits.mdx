description: "How your value grows — and why cash flow often looks like a loss on paper."

## Property appreciation

- **API-driven valuations** update monthly using MLS-level comps and appraisal-grade data.
- A 10% rise in market value shows as a 10 % bump in your dashboard holdings.

## Depreciation & K-1s

- Each property LLC passes through income and expenses to investors.
- **Depreciation** (27.5-yr schedule) is a non-cash deduction that can offset or exceed rental income.
- At tax time you receive a **Schedule K-1** for each property — download it right from your dashboard.

Example: You pocket \$500 in cash flow but a \$600 depreciation write-off shows a \$100 passive loss on your K-1. Cash in hand, loss on paper.
