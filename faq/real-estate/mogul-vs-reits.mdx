| **Ownership**        | Direct LLC interest in a single property                                                                           | Share in a corporation owning large mixed portfolio                                                                  |
| **Income Timing**    | Monthly                                                                                                            | Quarterly                                                                                                            |
| **Tax Shield**       | Depreciation passes through; cash yield often tax-deferred                                                         | 100 % of dividend is taxable at ordinary or qualified rates                                                          |
| **Fees**             | 5% one-time fee (equals \<1% per year over 5 year hold); 2.5 % of rental income (aligns incentives, extremely low) | 1 – 2 % of assets annually, plus admin overhead; potential promote structure at tail-end taking up to 20% of profits |
| **Control**          | Vote on big decisions                                                                                              | No say; public-market whims drive price                                                                              |
| **Price Volatility** | Tracks underlying real estate                                                                                      | Correlated with stock market swings                                                                                  |

Example: an 8 % cash yield potentiall stays 8 % after depreciation on mogul, but may net ~4-5 % after taxes in a REIT — and you still ride stock-market volatility.

When you invest with mogul, **you’re investing in real estate, not just a real-estate-themed stock**.
