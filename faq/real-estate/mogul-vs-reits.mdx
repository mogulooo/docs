title: "mogul vs. REITs"
description: "Why direct fractional ownership beats a one-size-fits-all REIT share."
---

| Topic | mogul | Typical Public REIT |
| ----- | ----- | ------------------- |
| **Ownership** | Direct LLC interest in a single property | Share in a corporation owning large mixed portfolio |
| **Income Timing** | Monthly | Quarterly |
| **Tax Shield** | Depreciation passes through; cash yield often tax-deferred | 100 % of dividend is taxable at ordinary or qualified rates |
| **Fees** | 2.5 % of rental income (aligns incentives) | 1 – 2 % of assets annually, plus admin overhead |
| **Control** | Vote on big decisions | No say; public-market whims drive price |
| **Price Volatility** | Tracks underlying real estate | Correlated with stock market swings |

Example: an 8 % cash yield stays 8 % after depreciation on mogul, but may net ~5 % after taxes in a REIT — and you still ride stock-market volatility.

When you invest with mogul, **you’re investing in real estate, not just a real-estate-themed stock**.
