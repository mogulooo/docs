## How are properties selected?

1. **Market conviction**  
   We model population growth, employment trends, migration flows, and price-to-rent ratios to choose target geographies.

2. **Define the buy-box**  
   Yields, price range, occupancy targets, square footage, comps, and more become hard criteria.

3. **Source inventory**  
   We share the buy-box with trusted local partners — investor-friendly brokerages, property managers, and operators.

4. **Screen ruthlessly**  
   < 1 % of thousands of deals make it through financial analysis, formal inspections, appraisals, and third-party diligence.

5. **Offer to investors**  
   Only the highest-conviction properties appear on the platform.
