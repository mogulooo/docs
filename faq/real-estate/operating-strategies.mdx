### Long-Term Rental (LTR)

- **Lease length:** ≥ 12 months
- **Pros:** Stable occupancy, predictable income, lower turnover costs, tenant-paid utilities
- **Cons:** Lower yield ceiling, must follow landlord-tenant laws, debt-service risk in high-rate climates

### Medium-Term Rental (MTR)

- **Lease length:** 1–12 months (3–6 mo sweet spot) — often PadSplit models
- **Pros:** Higher yield than LTR, still solid occupancy (travel nurses, grad students), mitigates high interest rates
- **Cons:** Appreciation not always as high, meaning value upon sale is not equivalent to other models

### Short-Term Rental (STR)

- **Stay length:** Nightly / weekly (Airbnb, Vrbo)
- **Pros:** Highest potential yield, dynamic pricing flexibility
- **Cons:** Regulatory risk, intensive management, seasonality, owner-paid utilities

mogul chooses the strategy that maximizes risk-adjusted returns for each property based on local regs, demand drivers, and numbers.
