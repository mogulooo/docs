**Master the Rewards Tab**

This isn’t just about tracking earnings; it’s a vital dashboard for understanding club health.

**Monitor Key Metrics**

Regularly check Active Members, Total Invested, and Rewards Distributed to gauge growth and activity levels.

**Identify Top Contributors**

Use data provided by your account manager to see which members are driving investment & referrals, and potentially reward or acknowledge their contributions.

**Communicate Value**

Use screenshots or summaries from the Rewards tab to transparently show members the collective benefits being generated from the growing community.

**Optimize Your Club Profile**

Your club’s public face matters, keep it looking crisp to encourage more people to join

**Keep Info Updated**

Regularly review and update your Club One Liner and Description to accurately reflect the club’s current focus or activity.

**Use High-Quality Media**

Ensure your Club Logo and Banner are clear, professional, and visually appealing to attract new members.

**Manage Privacy Settings Strategically**

Choose the right setting for your goals.

- **Public: **Best for maximum discoverability and easy joining, ideal for broad-topic clubs.
- **Private: **Good balance for discoverability while maintaining control over membership. Requires you to actively approve/deny requests.
- **Hidden:** Use for exclusive, invite-only groups where privacy is paramount.

**Engage Through the Community Feed**

This is your primary interaction space.

**Pin Important Posts**

Use a pinned post for welcome messages, club rules, or current key discussion topics.

**Use Formatting**

Make your posts easier to read using bold, italics, and links where appropriate.

**Facilitate Member Management (Private Clubs)**

- **Respond Promptly:** Address join requests in a timely manner to keep potential members engaged.
- **Communicate Decisions:** If denying a request, consider sending a brief, polite message explaining why (if appropriate).

**Leverage Your Chief Mogul Profile**

Your personal profile adds credibility.

- **Complete Your Socials: **Linking your professional profiles (especially LinkedIn) can help members learn more about you and build trust.
- **Maintain a Professional Bio:** Ensure your bio clearly states your role and interest in leading the club.

**Explore Platform Tools**

Familiarize yourself with all available tools and resources at your disposal:

- **Moderation: **Use available moderation tools (i.e., deleting posts, managing members) to maintain community standards.
- **Analytics: **Look for additional analytics beyond the Rewards tab to gain deeper insights into club performance by requesting them from your account manager.
- **Communication:** Utilize email to communicate privately and 1-on-1 with your club members
