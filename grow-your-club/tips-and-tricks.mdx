Regularly review and update your Club One Liner and Description to accurately reflect the club’s current focus or activity.

Ensure your Club Logo and Banner are clear, professional, and visually appealing to attract new members.

## **Manage Privacy Settings Strategically** ##

Choose the right setting for your goals.

- \*\*Public: \*\*Best for maximum discoverability and easy joining, ideal for broad-topic clubs.
- \*\*Private: \*\*Good balance for discoverability while maintaining control over membership. Requires you to actively approve/deny requests.

This is your primary interaction space.

Use a pinned post for welcome messages, club rules, or current key discussion topics.

Make your posts easier to read using bold, italics, and links where appropriate.

Your personal profile adds credibility.

- **Maintain a Professional Bio:** Ensure your bio clearly states your role and interest in leading the club.

## **Explore Platform Tools** ##

Familiarize yourself with all available tools and resources at your disposal:

- **Moderation:** Use available moderation tools (i.e., deleting posts, managing members) to maintain community standards.
- **Analytics:** Look for additional analytics beyond the Rewards tab to gain deeper insights into club performance by requesting them from your account manager.
- **Communication:** Utilize email to communicate privately and 1-on-1 with your club members
