## How do rewards work?

When any club member makes a **qualifying investment** on mogul,

`2 %` of that investment amount is credited to the club’s reward pool.

Example:

If Jordan invests \$5 000 through a club-linked transaction, \$100 (2 %) is earmarked for that club.

### Distribution

- **Default:** Rewards are split equally among current members.
- **Custom:** A Chief Mogul can configure different logic (e.g. pro-rata by investment volume) in club settings.

\> **Important:** Rewards are paid in cash to each member’s mogul balance; they are not automatically reinvested.

## Future incentives

mogul may introduce additional perks such as:

- **Milestone bonuses** for highly active clubs
- **Leaderboard recognition** for top Chief Moguls
- **Special access** to early property allocations
