mogul gives fractional owners a direct say in major property matters.

### Day-to-day vs. major decisions

- **\< \$1,000** or routine fixes → handled by the licensed property manager.
- **\> \$1,000** spend or strategy shifts (capital improvements, refinance, sale) → owner vote required.

### How a vote happens

1. Property manager assembles quotes, rationale, and usually two clear options.
2. Owners receive an email \+ dashboard alert with a voting deadline.
3. Votes are weighted to **ownership percentage** in the property LLC.
4. Outcome = super-majority threshold set in the operating agreement.
5. Non-responses default to the manager-recommended option, keeping projects moving.

### Funding approved work

Costs come from the **Maintenance Reserve** funded at acquisition, so no surprise capital calls.

This structure balances professional efficiency with true investor control.
