## Rental income & appreciation

- **Rental payouts:** Monthly once the property is operational (second Tuesday).  
- **Portfolio values:** Mark-to-market every month.  
- **Projected returns:** Displayed net of fees on each property page; test your own inputs in the Analysis tab.

## Exit options

1. **Hold to term** – Collect rent until typical 5–7 yr hold ends; vote to sell.  
2. **Secondary market (coming soon)** – Sell shares at fair market value before term.

## Sale process

- Near end of term, owners vote on selling.  
- Super-majority approval lists the home; offers are voted on.  
- Proceeds net of closing costs distribute pro-rata to wallets.  
- Share trading remains possible once secondary market launches.

## Reserves matter

- **Maintenance Reserve** – Covers big repairs (roof, HVAC) so no capital calls.  
- **Vacancy Reserve** – Covers debt service & fixed costs during empty months (8–12 months buffer).  

By capitalizing both reserves upfront — plus insurance for major events — mogul keeps cash flow predictable and investor peace of mind intact.
